			  	COPYING POLICIES

     Permission is hereby granted for copying and distribution of copies of
  the melm source files, and that of any part thereof, subject to the following 
  license conditions:

        1. You may, without additional permission from the authors, distribute 
           melm or components of melm, with or without additions developed by 
           you or by others at no charge.  You may also distribute melm along 
           with any other product for sale, provided that the cost of the 
           bundled package is the same regardless of whether melm is included,
           and provided that those interested only in melm must be notified 
           that it is a product freely available from the melm Development Group.

        2. You may, without additional permission from the authors, distribute 
	   copies of the melm Documentation, with or without additions developed by 
           you or by others at no charge or at a charge that covers the cost of
	   reproducing the copies, provided that the melm copyright notice is
	   retained.

        3. Furthermore, if you distribute melm software or parts of melm, with 
           or without additions developed by you or others, then you must 
           either make available the source to all portions of the melm system 
           (exclusive of any additions made by you or by others) upon request, 
           or instead you may notify anyone requesting source that it is 
           freely available from the melm Development Group.

        4. In addition, you may not omit any of the copyright notices
           on either the source files, the executable file, or the 
           documentation, and

        5. Also, you may not omit transmission of this License agreement with 
           whatever portions of melm that are distributed.

        6. Lastly, any users of this software must be notified that it is
           without warrantee or guarantee of any nature, express or implied, 
           nor is there any fitness for use represented.

Software is a malleable thing - especially UNIX - and the authors can in no
way guarantee that using this program will not cause grievous damage to your
system.  Of course this isn't anticipated, but if it does happen, the authors
cannot be held liable for any damages either directly or indirectly caused
by this event.

Modification of the system is encouraged, providing that the portions of 
the system that are from the original still carry the appropriate copyright
notices and that the changed sections are clearly delimited as such.  The
authors requests copies of any changes made to ensure that the various versions
stay reasonably in sync with each other.  Please send all revisions to
flash@virginia.edu.

NOTE that it is not permitted to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer any
of the melm software except as expressly indicated herein.  Any attempts to
do otherwise will be considered a violation of this license and your rights
to the melm software will be voided.
